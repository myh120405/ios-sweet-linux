# make's exit status is not the answer: config/Makefile's export check runs after the link and
# fails for any kernel, so the build is run with -k and judged by the kernel file and XNU's
# "built kernel at" line. Two rounds of stubs are possible:
#   1. link fails with undefined symbols -> generate every wrapper as kIOReturnUnsupported;
#   2. the kernel links -> regenerate, forwarding the wrappers whose _Impl the kernel has,
#      and relink. That is the shape the iig-generated code would have.

# so the implementation is written next to whatever .h it generated. In this build the generated
# headers end up in BUILD/obj/<config>/iokit/<KERNEL_CONFIG>/DriverKit/, one level below the
# object (BUILD/obj/<config>/iokit/<KERNEL_CONFIG>/OSObject.iig.cpo). Steps, in this order:
#   1. write the stub next to each generated OSObject.h and in the source tree, and touch it;
#   2. remove every DriverKit object in that layer so make compiles them again.
# The empty implementations of the other classes must be left alone: they are side effects of
# their .h rule, and with the .h in place make has no rule to recreate them ("No rule to make
# target 'DriverKit/OSAction.iig.cpp'"). They are empty because all the symbols they would carry
# are defined once, in OSObject.iig.cpp.
