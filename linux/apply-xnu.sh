# Put the kernel work on top of Apple's source release, on Linux.
#
#   1. fetch exactly one tag of apple-oss-distributions/xnu (shallow) and check its SHA;
#   2. run the patches/*.sh stage scripts from the tree root, as darwin-xnu-build does;
#   3. apply every patches/*.patch in name order;
#   4. make the one build-system adjustment Linux needs (see below).
#
# Nothing is skipped silently. A patch that does not apply is printed with the files it
# touches and the hunks that failed; then:
#   * STRICT_PATCHES=1  - it is a failure (the patches-audit job: this is the report);
#   * otherwise         - it is a failure unless it is one of the nine names in
#                         linux/known-skips.txt, which the macOS build skips too.
# The applied + known-skip counts must add up to the number of patch files, so a patch that
# disappears (empty glob, wrong directory) fails the run.
