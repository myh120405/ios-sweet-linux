# Generate the DriverKit implementation stubs the kernel link needs.
#
# Apple's iig is closed source: it turns iokit/DriverKit/<Class>.iig into the RPC marshalling
# that is compiled into the kernel. There is no open implementation, so the wrappers are
# reconstructed from the linker's own list of undefined symbols:
#   * a method the kernel already implements (a *_Impl symbol that exists) is forwarded to it;
#   * everything else (RPC dispatch, user-space-only methods) returns kIOReturnUnsupported.
# Only DriverKit user-space RPC is affected; the platform, display, timer and touch code does
# not go through these wrappers.
#
# usage: linux/iig-stubs.sh <build.log> [kernel.syms]
#   kernel.syms is `nm -n` of a kernel that linked: with it, the wrappers that can be
#   forwarded are. Without it every wrapper is a stub (the first pass).
